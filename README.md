# Minesweepax

A good old Minesweeper clone.

Made with the Python bindinds to Tkinter, the famous old-school graphical library.

I also stole what looks like the original Minesweeper sprites for maximum nostalgia (shhh!).

## How to run the game

You will need to install the Python bindings to Tkinter using your system's package manager. For most OSes it will be called something like: `python-tk` or `python-tkinter`. If in doubt, search on the web.

You will also need a single Python package (installable with pip, pipx, hatch, etc) called `pillow`. This is to load the nice sprites.

Then simply run `python3 .`, `python .` or `python.exe .` in this repository to launch the game.
